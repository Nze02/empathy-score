# TOBI Eye Tracker Dataset and Code

This repository contains code for analyzing the TOBI Eye Tracker dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from the [website](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01862-w).

## Dataset

To download the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [website](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01862-w#Sec10).
2. Click on the "Download" button.

## Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install tensorflow` in your terminal.
3. Open the notebook `main.ipynb`  && `main2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run the code cells in order to load and preprocess the dataset, train the MLP model, and evaluate the model's performance.
5. To use the trained model to predict empathy scores for new eye-tracking data, modify the code in the last code cell to load and preprocess the new data and make predictions using the trained model.
